SAGE: a Semantic Annotator for knowledge Graph Exploration (Version 1.0)

1. System Specification: SAGE runs only on systems with the operating systems Windows 10 and above.
2. The Folder Knowledge_Graphs store the RDF XML files of the vocabulary the user wants to explore.
3. The Folder Knowledge_Bases store the converted JSON files of the RDF-XML files in the Knowledge_Graphs Folder.
4. The user can store their graphs in the Knowledge_Bases folder through SAGE's interface and remove them too if not needed.
5. Click on the SAGE (exe file) in the folder to use SAGE.

Manual:
1. Upload knowledge graphs or ontologies in RDF/XML formats only.
2. Upload text in PDF, DOC, RTF and TXT extensions.
3. The CODO ontology [1] is preloaded in the system. 
4. Here are 2 sample text which you can copy paste and run SAGE and explore its features. You can use the preloaded codo ontology for doing so.
    [2] Title: Social network analysis of COVID-19 transmission in Karnataka, India
        Abstract: We used social network analysis (SNA) to study the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Karnataka, India, and to assess the potential of SNA as a tool for outbreak monitoring and control. We analysed contact tracing data of 1147 COVID-19 positive cases (mean age 34.91 years, 61.99% aged 11-40, 742 males), anonymised and made public by the Karnataka government. Software tools, Cytoscape and Gephi, were used to create SNA graphics and determine network attributes of nodes (cases) and edges (directed links from source to target patients). Outdegree was 1-47 for 199 (17.35%) nodes, and betweenness, 0.5-87 for 89 (7.76%) nodes. Men had higher mean outdegree and women, higher mean betweenness. Delhi was the exogenous source of 17.44% cases. Bangalore city had the highest caseload in the state (229, 20%), but comparatively low cluster formation. Thirty-four (2.96%) 'super-spreaders' (outdegree ⩾ 5) caused 60% of the transmissions. Real-time social network visualisation can allow healthcare administrators to flag evolving hotspots and pinpoint key actors in transmission. Prioritising these areas and individuals for rigorous containment could help minimise resource outlay and potentially achieve a significant reduction in COVID-19 transmission.

    [3] Title: Knowledge, Attitude and Perception Regarding COVID-19 Infection Control: A Cross-Sectional Study among Dentists in Bangalore City, India
        Abstract: The dental profession is one of the occupations at the highest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection because of the involvement of aerosol-generating procedures. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and perception of dentists regarding COVID19 infection control in Bangalore city. A cross-sectional study was conducted among dentists in Bangalore city using an online questionnaire. The questions were related to socio-demographic data and the knowledge, attitude and perceptions of the dentists towards COVID-19 and infection control during dental practice. A sample size of 254 dentists was obtained after duration of 2 months. Descriptive statistics were performed and the data obtained were presented in the form of graphs and tables. The study included 254 participants (188 females and 66 males) majority of whom belonged to an age group of < 30 years (78.3%). A total of 209 (83.3%) of the study participants have completed a master's degree in dentistry. Among 254 dentists, 141 (55.5%) of them had received training regarding infection control in dentistry while only 102 (40.2 %) of them had attended any training regarding COVID-19. Majority of the dentists were aware about the symptoms, modes of transmission, diagnosis, risk identification and important measures for prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Most of the dentists perceived COVID-19 as a serious public health issue (85.4%).
